## Clean Code Philosophy

The entire codebase follows industry-standard **clean code** principles:

- **SRP** (Single Responsibility Principle): Each function/component does exactly one thing
- **Meaningful naming**: Variables and functions are purpose-driven
- **Modularization**: Constants, components, storage utilities are separated
- **JSDoc comments**: For all major functions and helpers
- **Minimal side effects**: Async operations are safely wrapped
- **Development logging**: Active only in `__DEV__` mode for clarity
